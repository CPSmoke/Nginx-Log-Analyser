## Instructions for Using
1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository containing your script:

    ```bash
    git clone <URL_of_your_repository>
    cd <repository_folder>
Replace <URL_of_your_repository> with the link to your GitHub repository.

2. Create a Log File
Make sure you have a web server log file that you want to analyze. For example, the file might be named access.log.

3. Create the Script File
Create a file for your script commands. For example, name it analyze_logs.sh:

    ```bash
    nano analyze_logs.sh
Insert your script into the file and save the changes (if you're using nano, press CTRL + O to save, then ENTER, and to exit, press CTRL + X).

4. Make the File Executable
Now, you need to make the file executable using the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x analyze_logs.sh
5. Run the Script
Now you can run the script by passing it the path to the log file. For example:

    ```bash
    ./analyze_logs.sh access.log
